Run-it:

Run-it is a code testing software designed to run on servers. In many ways, it draws parallels to RCOS's submitty, where you submit your code to a server, where it gets run, and the user receives feedback. In our case, the feedback that the user receives is different from Submitty's. The feedback that Run-it gives is performance-related metrics instead of grading metrics, along with the code output. All instances of code that are uploaded are run on their own virtual machines with user-configurable parameters.

Features: (Our short-term goals)
- Currently Supported Languages: C++/C
- Tracks data related to the code execution:
  -> Execution Time
  -> AVG/MAX RAM Useage
  -> AVG/MAX CPU Utilization
  -> Code Output
- Virtual Machine is User-Configurable:
  -> Number of Threads
  -> GBs of RAM
- Utilizes IPMI for remote management

Currently, we have 1 node server for our service, although a second server node is on the way:
Node #1: Dual Xeon E5-2699V3, 36 Cores / 72 Threads, 64GB Ram (plans to expand ram later)
Node #2: Dual Xeon E5-2690V3, 24 Cores / 48 Threads, 32GB Ram (plans to expand?)
Although our software should be able to run on any server with IPMI, it will be mainly tested with servers with SuperMicro Motherboards.

Long-term features:
- Supporting multiple programming languages:
  -> Java
  -> Python
  -> MIPS Assembly
  -> x86-64 Assembly
  -> Verilog/VHDL (using a built-in FPGA)
  -> GPU Programming APIs (CUDA/ROCm)
- Advanced debugging features, including stack/heap variable history
- Multi-Node Scalability
- Advanced Task Scheduling Queue
- Sandboxing + Malicious Code Detection
