It seems that I need file permissions to read, write, and execute files, do this using sudo chmod permissions on the results.out file, and the files we want to execute. 
For the files we want to execute, we should just make the entire directory executable permissions, find a way to do that
Results.out should get read/write permissions

We also want to fix the find command in the startup.sh script. The cmd is apparently the name or directory and I think we can remove that. Please research more into it
