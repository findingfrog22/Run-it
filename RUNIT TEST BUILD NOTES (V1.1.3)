The startup setup is still there, need to find a way to link the autoinstall for cloud-init properly

What works:
- Python autorun files work, now without the headers too

Current Issues:
- C++ only half works, it gets to results.out file, but fails to fully compile. the Output file name scheming is empty at '', so we need to fix that
- Java fails to compile, invalid option upon compilation
- C++ and Java need compilation before running the files, needs more complex script, their own script with potentially their own folders and outputs.

potential fixes:
- search this up online, "how to autorun java and c++ files in linux with the find command"
