The startup setup is still there, need to find a way to link the autoinstall for cloud-init properly

What works:
- Python autorun files work, now without the headers too
- C++ and Java now autorun, with auto-compilation too

Current Issues:
- The output file results.out gets overwritten every time a file executes
- No C support yet

potential fixes:
- none, will look into later

Action for V1.2.1:
- Add C support
- Fix output file issue where it gets overwritten
