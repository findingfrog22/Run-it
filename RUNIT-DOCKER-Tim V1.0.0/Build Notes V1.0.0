Current Changes:
- Added modifications from RUNIT 1.2.1 test builds of ubuntu ISOs to docker image template file and new scripts.
- Added Dockerfile
- Added setup.sh
- Added startup.sh

What works:
- The internal .sh scripts both work, but they need files to autorun, and a persistant results.out file that we can see after the container closes

What needs work:
- We need to make the output persistent so we can see it after the container ends

To do next time: (V1.0.1)
- Add support for a CODE volume for code input
- Add support for a OUTPUT volume for code output
- Making sure the scripts internally pull files from CODE and output to OUTPUT
