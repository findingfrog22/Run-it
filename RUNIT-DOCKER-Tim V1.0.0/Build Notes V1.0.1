Current Changes:
- Added compose.yaml
- Modified startup.sh to call to mounted volume locations

What works:
- The internal .sh scripts both work, but they need files to autorun, and a persistant results.out file that we can see after the container closes
- The volumes are mounted, and the scripts do mention the locations where they are mounted (but we don't know if it does anything yet)

What needs work:
- We need to make the output persistent so we can see it after the container ends
- Need to make the volume access actually work and do something (need to put code files into the CODE virtual volume)

To do next time: (V1.0.2)
- Fix container scripting to access CODE Volume
- Add actual code test files into the CODE virtual volume
- Fix container scripting to access OUTPUT Volume
- Making sure the scripts internally pull files from CODE and output to OUTPUT
